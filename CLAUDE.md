## 🎨 UI/UX Design

### Design System
- **Color Palette**: Purple/Pink gradient theme with accent colors
- **Typography**: System fonts with clear hierarchy
- **Layout**: Responsive grid system with card-based components
- **Animations**: Subtle hover effects and transitions
- **Icons**: Lucide React with emoji accents for child-friendly UI

### Component Library
- **Cards**: `.card`, `.card-cute` for different contexts
- **Buttons**: `.btn-primary`, `.btn-secondary` with gradients
- **Forms**: `.input-field` with consistent styling
- **Quest Cards**: Specialized styling for gamification

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach with responsive breakpoints
- Grid layouts adapt from 1 column (mobile) to 4 columns (desktop)
- Touch-friendly button sizes and spacing

## 🔐 Authentication & Security

### Authentication Flow
1. **Registration**: Email/password with role selection (PARENT/CHILD)
2. **Family Creation**: Parents automatically create new families
3. **Child Accounts**: Parents can create child accounts with auto-generated credentials
4. **Session Management**: Supabase handles token refresh and persistence

### Security Measures
- **Row Level Security**: Database-level access control
- **Family Isolation**: Users can only access their family data
- **Input Validation**: Form validation and TypeScript type safety
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with user feedback

## 📊 Data Flow

### State Management Pattern
```
Supabase DB ↔ useAuth Hook ↔ Components ↔ LocalStorage (fallback)
```

### Key Data Operations
1. **Task Creation**: Parent creates → Database → Real-time update to children
2. **Task Completion**: Child submits → Database → Parent approval interface
3. **Point Calculation**: Dynamic rules applied → Transaction recorded → Balance updated
4. **Family Management**: Supabase Auth integration → Profile creation → Family association

## 🚀 Development & Deployment

npm install          # Install dependencies
npm run dev         # Start development server (port 5173)

- **Utility functions**: Shared logic in `/utils` directory
- **Custom hooks**: Reusable stateful logic

### Naming Conventions
- **Components**: PascalCase with descriptive names
- **Files**: Match component names exactly
- **Functions**: camelCase with verb-noun pattern
- **Types**: PascalCase with descriptive interfaces

### Best Practices
- **Prop drilling**: Minimize through context and custom hooks
- **State management**: Keep state close to where it's used
- **Error handling**: Graceful degradation with user feedback
- **Performance**: Lazy loading and code splitting where appropriate

## 🚨 Claude Code Development Best Practices & Common Pitfalls

### ⚠️ Next.js App Router Specific Issues (Future Reference)

#### 1. **Route Groups vs Nested Routing**
```typescript
❌ WRONG: Treating (admin) as nested routing
app/
  (admin)/page.tsx  // This conflicts with app/page.tsx!
  page.tsx

✅ CORRECT: Route groups for organization only
app/
  (admin)/
    dashboard/page.tsx
    users/page.tsx
  page.tsx
```

#### 2. **Data Fetching: Server Components First**
```typescript
❌ WRONG: useEffect in every component
function Component() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  useEffect(() => {
    fetchData().then(setData);
  }, []);
}

✅ CORRECT: Server Component with Data Access Layer
// lib/dal.ts - Data Access Layer
export async function getUserData(id: string) {
  const data = await db.user.findUnique({ where: { id } });
  return data;
}

// app/users/[id]/page.tsx - Server Component
async function UserPage({ params }: { params: { id: string } }) {
  const user = await getUserData(params.id);
  return <UserProfile user={user} />;
}
```

#### 3. **Streaming Data Fetching with Suspense**
```typescript
❌ WRONG: Single loading state for entire page
function Page() {
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  // ... fetch all data at once
}

✅ CORRECT: Streaming with Suspense boundaries
function Page() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Suspense fallback={<HeaderSkeleton />}>
        <Header />
      </Suspense>
      <Suspense fallback={<ContentSkeleton />}>
        <Content />
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### 4. **Server Actions vs Client Event Handlers**
```typescript
❌ WRONG: Client-side form handling by default
function Form() {
  const handleSubmit = async (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    await fetch('/api/submit', { method: 'POST', ... });
  };
}

✅ CORRECT: Server Actions first
// app/actions.ts
'use server'
export async function submitForm(formData: FormData) {
  // Server-side form processing
  const data = Object.fromEntries(formData);
  await db.create(data);
  revalidatePath('/dashboard');
}

// Component
function Form() {
  return <form action={submitForm}>...</form>;
}
```

#### 5. **Async Params and SearchParams**
```typescript
❌ WRONG: Synchronous params access
function Page({ params, searchParams }: {
  params: { id: string };
  searchParams: { tab: string };
}) {
  // This will error in newer Next.js versions
}

✅ CORRECT: Async params access
async function Page({ 
  params, 
  searchParams 
}: {
  params: Promise<{ id: string }>;
  searchParams: Promise<{ tab: string }>;
}) {
  const { id } = await params;
  const { tab } = await searchParams;
}
```

#### 6. **Supabase Client vs Server Client**
```typescript
❌ WRONG: Using client everywhere
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';
const supabase = createClient(url, key); // Wrong for server-side

✅ CORRECT: Context-appropriate clients
// Client Component
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';
const supabase = createClient(url, key);

// Server Component/Action
import { createServerClient } from '@supabase/ssr';
const supabase = createServerClient(url, key, {
  cookies: () => cookieStore
});
```

### 🔧 Current Project (Vite + React) Improvements Applied

#### **1. Reduced useEffect Usage**
- ✅ Authentication state managed through context, not multiple useEffects
- ✅ Data fetching centralized in custom hooks
- ✅ Event-driven updates instead of polling with useEffect

#### **2. Enhanced Loading States with Suspense**
```typescript
// Already implemented in ParentDashboard.tsx
const EventManagement = React.lazy(() => import('./EventManagement'));
const Statistics = React.lazy(() => import('./Statistics'));

<Suspense fallback={<ComponentSkeleton />}>
  <EventManagement />
</Suspense>
```

#### **3. Optimized Data Fetching**
- ✅ Custom hooks for data management (`useAuth`, `useNotifications`)
- ✅ Centralized database operations in `utils/database.ts`
- ✅ Error boundaries for graceful failure handling

#### **4. Performance Optimizations**
- ✅ Lazy loading of heavy components
- ✅ Chunk splitting for optimal bundle sizes
- ✅ Code splitting with React.lazy()
- ✅ Memoization where appropriate

#### **5. Current Architecture Benefits**
```
✅ Type-safe with TypeScript throughout
✅ Centralized state management via Context
✅ Component isolation with clear boundaries
✅ Error handling with ErrorBoundary
✅ Progressive loading with Suspense
✅ Optimized build output with Vite
```

### 📋 Development Checklist for Future Projects
